* Classic machine learning: 
  * human designed representations and features
  * Optimize weights to make best final prediction

* **Representation Learning** - learn good features or representation automatically

* **Deep learning** to automatically learn multiple levels of abstraction

* Learning representations automatically is great bc handcrafting is time
  consuming and often results in overspecified and incomplete

* Atomic representations make systems fragile.  Deep learning results in 
  robust distributed representations
